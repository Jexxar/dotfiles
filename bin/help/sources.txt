The additional repository should be saved in the :    /etc/apt/sources.list.d

So create new file, for example:      etc/apt/sources.list.d/widelands-daily.list
      and past the repo:
            deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/widelands-dev/widelands-daily/ubuntu yakkety main
            deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/widelands-dev/widelands-daily/ubuntu yakkety main
Try to install public key in this way:
         sudo gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv key-ID
         sudo gpg --export key-ID | apt-key add -
it means, it your case:
        sudo gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 358E1F6F
        sudo gpg --export 358E1F6F | apt-key add -
