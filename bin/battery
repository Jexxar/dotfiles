# A simple script to display battery percent
# Taken from Anachron i3blocks
# I only slightly modify this script to add an option to show icon
# I also remove the i3blocks specify script
# To make this works with tint2 executor, polybar custom script, dzen2 feeder, conkybar, lemonbar feeder, dunst notify, etc.
# 'battery -i' = with icon, 'battery' = text only
# Cheers!
# Adapted from Addy
