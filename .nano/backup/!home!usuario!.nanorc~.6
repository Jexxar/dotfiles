# Use bold text instead of reverse video text.
set boldtext

# Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces 
# as the previous line (or as the next line if the previous line is the beginning of 
# a paragraph).
set autoindent

# Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying paragraphs.
# They cannot contain blank characters. Only closing punctuation, optionally

# is ""')>]}".
set brackets string ""')>]}"

# Do case sensitive searches by default.
set casesensitive

# Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
set constantshow

# Use cut to end of line by default.
unset cut

# Wrap lines at column number n. If n is 0 or less, the maximum line length
# will be the screen width less n columns. The default value is -8.
set fill "-8"

# Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.
set historylog

# Set the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket searches.
# They cannot contain blank characters. The former set must come before the
# latter set, and both must be in the same order. The default value
# is "(<[{)>]}".
set matchbrackets string "(<[{)>]}"

# Use of the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.
unset morespace

# Enable mouse support, so that mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor,
# set the mark (with a double click), or execute shortcuts.

# Allow inserting files into their own buffers.

# Don't add newlines to the ends of files.
set nonewlines

# Don't wrap text at all.
set nowrap

# nano will only read and write files inside directory and its subdirectories.
# Also, the current directory is changed to here, so files are inserted from
# this diractory. By default, the operating directory feature is turned off.
# set operatingdir "directory"

# Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
unset preserve

# Make Ctrl+Right stop at word ends instead of beginnings.
set afterends

# Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying paragraphs.
# They cannot contain blank characters. Only closing punctuation, optionally
# followed by closing brackets, can end sentences. The default value is "!.?".
set punct "!.?"

# Do quick statusbar blanking. Statusbar messages will disappear after 1
# keystroke instead of 25.
unset quickblank

# The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs. This is an
# extended regular expression if your system supports them, otherwise a
# literal string. The default value is "^([ \t]*[#:>\|}])+" if you have
# extended regular expression support, or "> " otherwise. Note that '\t'
# stands for a literal Tab character.
set quotestr "^([ \\t]*[#:>\\|}])+"

# Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and Delete work
# properly. You should only need to use this option if Backspace acts like
# Delete on your system.
unset rebinddelete

# Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly. You should
# only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support won't work
# properly with this option enabled.
unset rebindkeypad

# Do extended regular expression searches by default.
set regexp

# Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very
# beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that
# beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the cursor is already at that
# position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.
set smarthome

# Use smooth scrolling by default.
set smooth

# Use spelling checker spellprog instead of the built-in one, which calls
# "spell".
#set speller "aspell"

# Allow nano to be suspended.
set suspend

set positionlog

# Use a tab size of "n" columns. The value of n must be greater than 0. The
# default value is 8.
set tabsize "4"

# Convert typed tabs to spaces
set tabstospaces

# Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.
unset tempfile

# Disallow file modification.
unset view

# Set the two characters used to display the first characters of tabs and
# spaces. They must be single-column characters.
# set whitespace "string"

# Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation characters
# as part of a word.
unset wordbounds

## Enable the new (EXPERIMENTAL) generic undo code, not just for line cuts
# set undo

## Enable soft line wrapping (AKA full line display)
set softwrap

## Key bindings
## Please see nanorc(5) for more details on this
##
## Here are some samples to get you going
##
# bind M-W nowrap main
# bind M-A casesens search

## Set this if your backspace key sends delete most of the time (2.1.3+)
# bind kdel backspace all

bind ^c copytext main
bind ^x cut main
bind ^v uncut main
bind ^z undo main
bind ^y redo main
bind ^f whereis main
bind ^h replace main
bind ^w exit main
