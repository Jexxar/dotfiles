It looks really great! I’ve try to test it, but i’m having some troubles. I’ve download all the files and put them on /usr/share/mc/skins, then I try to use it by starting mc with ‘–skin=ini’, or the other file names, but nothing. It always says ‘imposible to process skin’. I guess I’m missing something. Could you give me a hand? 
Thks!
